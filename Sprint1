Identifying Problems
1. Satelites
2. Senecard
3. Campus interactive map: New students often struggle to navigate campus. To address this,
an interactive campus map application is proposed. It will provide building locations,
dining and study area information, and directions.
4. Improper disposal of recyclable and reusable materials is a significant problem on university campuses.
A platform could help students and faculty identify, dispose, reuse, and repurpose these materials. 
This platform should also promote waste reduction efforts and connect users with local businesses participating 
in circular economy initiatives.
